   then add website files 
-> cd your filename
-> git lfs install
-> git lfs track "*.mov"
-> git add .
-> git commit -m "LFS"
-> git push origin main

then upload edited file and add a new file on same repositories
note: use vs code terminal

-> open the same repo folder on vs code 
-> type git status
-> It looks like you have modified, deleted, and added files in your project.         Follow these steps to stage, commit, and push your changes to GitHub:
